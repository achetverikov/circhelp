# Resubmission

This is a resumbission:
* All T / F replaced with TRUE / FALSE
* print() replaced with message() or cat(). The only place where print() is used is to show the plots during the remove_cardinal_biases() execution when explicitly requested by the user. 
* Package description changed, references describing the methods added. 

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
