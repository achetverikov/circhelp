# circhelp

[![CRAN
status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/circhelp)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=circhelp)
<!-- badges: end -->

`circhelp` is a small helper package for circular data analyses in R,
particularly useful for cognitive studies on orientation, motion
direction, and other circular features. The package contains functions
for descriptive statistics of circular data (computing means, SD, and
skewness), angular differences, and correlation. It also includes a
function to correct for cardinal biases in human estimates of circular
features (e.g., orientation). The documentation is available in the
package help files and at <https://achetverikov.github.io/circhelp/>.

## Installation

You can install the latest released version from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("circhelp")
```

The current developmental version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can
be installed with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("achetverikov/circhelp")
```

## Usage

Most functions are self-explanatory.

#> [1] -165

# compute correlation between angles
data <- rmvn(10000, c(0, 0), V = matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), ncol = 2))
circ_corr(data[, 1], data[, 2])
#> [1] 0.4360442
```

The only (somewhat) complicated function is `remove_cardinal_biases`,
see the [help
files](https://achetverikov.github.io/circhelp/reference/remove_cardinal_biases.html)
and [the
vignette](https://achetverikov.github.io/circhelp/articles/cardinal_biases.html)
for an example use case.
